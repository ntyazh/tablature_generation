This work is an implementation of the paper "Rock Guitar Tablature Generation via Natural Language Processing" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05295) on pytorch. It uses GPT-architecture to generate heavy rock tablature. 

The results of the paper have been achieved. Moreover, the final .gp5 files with the tabs are attached, so you can check the results on your own.

P.S. You can read the more extended explanation in the presentation (pdf-file).
